## To help you get the most from your IBM API Connect trial here are a set of resources. Whether you need help getting started or trying out more of our advanced features we’ve got you covered.

# Getting started
When you first log into the trial you have the option of using a guided tour. In a matter of minutes this will walk you through creating and testing a sample API, setting security policies, then how to analyze its usage. Depending on your preferences you can either use the step-by-step tutorial or watch a video.

# Analyzing your APIs
For details beyond those covered in the getting started tutorial this short video goes into more details of the built in analytics including dashboards, filtering and search capabilities. Gain insights and debug issues directly within the service.

Alongside the built in analytics there are options to offload these to an external service to perform a more holistic data search, view custom visualizations, and retain the analytics data for longer periods of time.  Our documentation provides examples for doing this with Amazon S3 and Splunk.

# Socializing your APIs via a customized Developer Portal 
Sharing your APIs with application developers is quick and easy using a customized Developer Portal.  In addition to allowing application developers to find and subscribe to APIs, the Developer Portal provides additional features including forums, blogs, comments, and ratings, together with an administrative interface for customizing the Developer Portal to your brand and theme. 

Our documentation covers everything from understanding key concepts to guided tutorials for creating and customizing your portal. Alternatively, you can watch the video covering the key portal capabilities.
