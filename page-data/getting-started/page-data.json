Whether you need help getting started or trying out more of our advanced capabilities we’ve got you covered.\n\n## Getting started\nWhen you first log into the trial you have the option of using a guided tour. In a matter of minutes this will walk you through creating and testing a sample API, setting security policies, then how to analyze its usage. Below are the direct links to this content outside of the in-product guided tour.\n\n[Watch a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQXiiIXY0vU) and follow along with the [step by step tutorial](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/sample-orders-api)\n\n## Analyzing your APIs\nTo get a better understanding of the built in analytics including dashboards, filtering and search capabilities take a quick video tour.  \n\n[Tour of the analytics video](https://youtu.be/dZT2Y3zi00I)\n\nAlongside the built in analytics there are options to offload data to an external service to perform a more holistic data search, view custom visualizations, and retain the analytics data for longer periods of time.  Our documentation provides examples for doing this with Amazon S3 and Splunk.\n\n[Offloading Analytics Data tutorial](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/api-connect/saas?topic=apis-offloading-analytics-data)\n\n## Socializing your APIs via a customized Developer Portal \nSharing your APIs with application developers is quick and easy using a customized Developer Portal.  \nOur documentation covers everything from understanding initial concepts to guided tutorials for creating and customizing your portal. Alternatively, you can watch a video covering the key capabilities. \n\n[Watch a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qpShpXtz-Q&list=PL_4RxtD-BL5vnqTh3YXwLkap_P4oW-MSy&index=13) or [read the documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/api-connect/saas?topic=developer-portal-socialize-your-apis) \n\n## Advanced capabilities\nOnce you’ve explored the basics you may be interested in several other features. We’ve highlighted a few below and can also take you through these and many more by [booking a live demo](https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-51877).\n\n## AWS Lambda Integration\nRoute and protect your AWS Lambda Functions via a Gateway Policy that simplifies routing to backend serverless endpoints securely and authenticated. This compliments our existing support for gateway routing to application endpoints hosted on traditional EC2 instances and those running in containers on EKS and ROSA services on AWS.\n\n[Watch a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDKfzBSCvVA&t=5s) or [read the documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/api-connect/saas?topic=policies-lambda)\n\n## Automate API Test generation\nSave time and improve API quality using AI enabled smart test generation to rapidly automate the creation of API Tests.\n\n[Watch a video](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/integration/blogs/swetha-sridharan1/2022/12/14/api-test-creation-in-seconds-using-smart-generatio) or [read the documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/api-connect/saas?topic=started-creating-test)\n\n## Create mock API responses using message template policies\nIterate faster without waiting on back end systems when designing APIs by using a built-in policy to create mock API responses. Building on the getting started tutorial this video shows you how to extend the sample API with conditional logic, mock responses and how to debug problems.\n\n[Watch a video](https://youtu.be/NrkfjSaOHck) or [read the documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/api-connect/saas?topic=started-creating-test) \n\n## Get your questions answered\nWe offer live demos from our technical specialists who can show you advanced features and answer any questions. You can attend our regular office hours and speak to the experts.  We also have an active community who publish blogs and is another place to ask questions along with our YouTube playlist for further technical demos. \n\n[Request a live demo](https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-51877)\n\n[Sign up for our next office hours](https://ibm.biz/apic-saas-office-hours)\n\n[API Connect Community](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/integration/communities/community-home?communitykey=2106cca0-a9f9-45c6-9b28-01a28f4ce947)\n\n[API Connect YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_4RxtD-BL5vnqTh3YXwLkap_P4oW-MSy)\n\n\n\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"c62de6521a455d9bfc054c077ef6d865","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":971},"frontmatter":{"title":"Welcome to your IBM API Connect Trial","description":"Get started immediately with API Connect on AWS"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Welcome to your IBM API Connect Trial\ndescription: Get started immediately with API Connect on AWS\n---\n\n\n## To help you get the most from your IBM API Connect trial here are a set of resources.
